# TensorFlow Embeddings: Minimalistic Example

This code is a minimalistic example of how to use TensorBoard visualization
of embeddings saved in a TensorFlow session. You can find the video explaining the code [here](https://youtu.be/n4gR6XmJBok).

The only dependency to run this example is to have docker installed.

To run the example simply execute the `run.sh` script. Then, to view
the visualization of the embeddings go to [http://localhost:6006/#embeddings](http://localhost:6006/#embeddings).
